Recently, the developer met the following error message while trying to create a java object using SQL Developer:
ORA-29538: Java not installed

Well, first let’s check if the JVM components is really not installed in Oracle – verify installed components:

1 in TOAD check
select comp_name, version, status from dba_registry;


to be double sure, we run another query which should return no rows:

2 in TOAD chcek
select distinct owner,name from dba_source where lower(NAME)='dbms_java';

3 Use sqlplus go to $ORACLE_HOME...... and @nitjvm.sql
So, to install the JVM you should run (sys as sysdba) initjvm.sql located in $ORACLE_HOME\javavm\install:
5 min install 

Now, check if JVM was installed successfully:

4
select comp_name, version, status from dba_registry;


The problem solved
